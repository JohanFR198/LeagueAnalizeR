Description: This package is intended to be used as a data extraction package from League of Legends API. Also the functions within this package allows the user to start the analysis quickly, since all the functions contained here will return data.frames or simple lists, instead of nested lists, saving time to the analyzer.The data contained in each data frame will vary, you will be able to see al kind of data, space, temporal variables, characters and numeric ones. There is a limitation from RIOT API that does not allow a user to do more than 20 queries by minute or 100 every 2 minutes, so for some of the functions, you will see Sys.sleeps and the reason of those is to avoid a ban from the API.
