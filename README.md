# LeagueAnalizeR

LeagueAnalizeR is an R package intended to be used as a data extraction tool to get data of League Of Legends directly from RIOT GAMES API. All the functions contained here will return a data.frame, helping the analyst to spend less time transforming the data from a nested list to a data.frame to start its visualizations or modelling. 

In a future probably will also include pipelines to get massive data, or even pipelines to analize it.
